/**
 * Does any observed quota window BLOCK this subject right now?
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a third copy of blocking semantics: each subject snapshot is
 * judged by the schema's own `quotaSnapshotAvailability` projection — the same
 * verdict the /v2/quota surface and the Accounts card show — so preflight can
 * never dispatch into a window the projection already calls unavailable.
 *
 * Two deliberate contrasts with `profileHeadroomBreach` (which stays fresh-only
 * for its configured usage threshold):
 * - STALE evidence blocks too. A cooldown/reset instant is absolute clock
 *   truth: the registry keeps a stale snapshot alive exactly because its
 *   `cooldown_until` still extends into the future (activeSnapshots), and a
 *   reactive vendor limit observed six minutes ago is still a live limit even
 *   though its snapshot has aged past the 5-minute fresh horizon.
 * - Blocking is EVIDENCE-of-limit, not usage-ratio proximity: an expired or
 *   unknown-reset window never blocks (the projection treats it as stale data).
 *
 * Model scope fails OPEN by construction: the projection matches by
 * case-insensitive alias containment, so a vendor display label
 * ("Gemini 3.7 Flash High") that cannot be proven to cover the routed slug
 * ("grok-4.6" — or even an unprovable "gemini-3.7-flash") leaves the subject
 * spendable rather than cooling every model on the account. A scoped window
 * with NO model context blocks only when it declares it governs the
 * unspecified-model route.
 *
 * The subject KEY includes `credential_route` (final-review fix): the
 * native-session default and the managed-api-key default of one harness BOTH
 * carry subject_id=null, so without the route an api_key cooldown would cool
 * the subscription session (and vice versa). `subjectRoute` speaks the
 * callers' vocabulary (`limitSubjectRoute`); `null` = honestly unknown route —
 * fail open to the legacy any-route match rather than unblocking on a
 * technicality (no current caller passes null).
