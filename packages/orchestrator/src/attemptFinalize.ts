/**
 * D-16 unified attempt finalizer.
 *
 * ONE owner for the "did this attempt deliver, and in what work_state?" decision
 * — replacing the three divergent deliverable predicates (candidate diff||answer;
 * planner no-error⇒delivered; read-only nonempty-report). It folds the raw
 * intent-specific deliverable evidence with the model-authored WorkReport, the
 * typed context signals, the harness error state, and the gates into:
 *   - a final `deliverablePresent`,
 *   - a `work_state` axis (orthogonal to lifecycle, INV-116),
 *   - a typed reason,
 *   - and the class of outcome (clean / veto / contract-failure / interrupted).
 *
 * The module is PURE (no I/O, no clock). The envelope compile/unwrap half lives
 * in `workReportEnvelope.ts`; the spec-build decision, the unwrap and this
 * finalizer read one contract (`WorkReportEnvelopeMode` / `UnwrappedAnswer`).
