/**
 * The continuation notice (B1): what a continued vendor process is told.
 *
 * On a NATIVE carrier the original prompt is never resent — the transcript
 * already holds it — so the engine sends one constant notice as the user
 * prompt, followed by the caller's text when any. Every new fact travels in
 * the prompt, never in `instructions`: Claude Code records the system prompt on
 * the first request and resends that record on resume, so instructions are not
 * a continuation channel.
 *
 * On a PACKET carrier the successor is a fresh session: it receives the
 * original prompt (engine constraints included), the notice and the bounded
 * evidence index.
 *
 * Unknown input (R3-Astra): when the predecessor's last input may not be in
 * the vendor history (a crash between recovery and the turn start), the notice
 * carries it as a reference to reconcile against the observed work — never as a
 * blind replay.
