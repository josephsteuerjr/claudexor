/**
 * TTL + single-flight cache for the daemon's poll-heavy status projections.
 *
 * Hit live 2026-08-04: a UI polling `/v2/credential-profiles` and
 * `/v2/harnesses` every 5 seconds made the daemon spawn full harness sweeps
 * (discover + doctor for every adapter, plus a doctor probe per registered
 * credential profile) on EVERY tick — each sweep shells out to the vendor
 * CLIs, takes >8s under load, and starves the daemon's request loop until an
 * interactive login POST times out client-side ("Daemon unreachable:
 * ReadTimeout"). The poller needs cheap reads, not fresh probes per tick, so
 * these projections now serve the last computed value inside a short TTL and
 * coalesce concurrent recomputes into one in-flight sweep. An explicit
 * fresh/snapshot request still bypasses the TTL, and a credential-state
 * change (login/logout) invalidates every registered cache so a fresh login
 * is visible on the next poll rather than a TTL later.
