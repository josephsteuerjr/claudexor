A secret-like string in agent output no longer rolls back an in-place patch, discards an isolated candidate or drops the answer. The changed files keep the exact bytes; the saved `patch.diff` copies and reviewer packets carry `[redacted]` (a flagged binary payload is withheld), and the run discloses paths and counts in `secret_like` (attempt record, work-product meta, one `summary.md` line, `secretLike` on the MCP read tools), never a matched value. `patch_sha256` stays the digest of the exact patch: Apply, apply/check and the `accept_risk` binding read a private exact patch object and answer 409 `patch_exact_bytes_unavailable` when it is missing. `pr` delivery refuses a secret-like patch before any push while local apply, branch and commit stay allowed; served media and other binaries that match the content policy answer 409 `secret_like_content_withheld`; the raw API no longer refuses a proposal for its content. Only a capture that cannot observe the changes is still a refusal, now named `capture_refusal` in phase `workspace` (the `secret_diff_refusal` attempt field, the `secret_diff_refused` / `secret_recovery` work-product fields and the `artifact_security` phase for patch runs are gone).
