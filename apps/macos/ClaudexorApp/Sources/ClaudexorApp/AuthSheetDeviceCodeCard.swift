// MARK: - D-17 login disclosure AuthSheet card
//
// The no-Terminal login surface: a large one-time code with an explicit Copy
// button (never auto-copied), an "Open private sign-in" button that starts an
// ephemeral ASWebAuthenticationSession, a Waiting state, and Cancel. Codex's
// app-server flows also carry an explicit browser-callback opt-in for orgs that
// disable device-code login (no silent fallback). Pure rendering — every
// mutation is a caller closure.
//
// This card is NOT codex-only: a terminal-mode claude/cursor login discloses
// its captured `oauth_url` through the same overlay, so every line naming a
// vendor reads it from the job instead of asserting OpenAI.
//
// The `oauth_url_input` flow (claude and Antigravity) adds the paste half: the
// link itself with Open/Copy, a one-shot code field wired to
// POST /v2/setup/jobs/:id/input, and a lapsed-window state that replaces the
// dead link instead of leaving it on screen — a BOUNDED number of times, after
// which the user's own button is the way forward.
