/// `harness install --dry-run --json` disclosure — exact command, install
/// destination, and version pin — and the installer itself runs in the
/// visible embedded terminal, where the user watches it like interactive
/// SSH auth. Claude and Codex install the exact pinned npm version this
/// release was verified against; OpenCode and GitHub Copilot install their
/// exact pins as deterministic install targets (no recorded verification
/// fixture covers them); the script vendors (Antigravity and Cursor) have their installer
/// downloaded in full and executed under the user's eyes because they
/// cannot be pinned. Every vendor NAME here comes from `HarnessFamily.label`
/// — never `id.capitalized`, which renders Antigravity as "Agy".
